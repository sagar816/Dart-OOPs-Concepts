/* in dart , String? name; this is nullable or non nullable. Please explain?

In Dart, when you declare a variable with a `String?` type, like `String? name;`, this means that the variable `name` is nullable. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what this means:

1. **Nullable Type**: The `?` after the `String` type indicates that the variable can hold either a value of type `String` or a `null` value. In other words, `name` can be a `String` or it can be `null`.

   ```dart
   String? name;
   name = "Alice"; // Valid
   name = null; // Also valid
   ```

2. **Non-Nullable Type**: If you were to declare `name` as `String` without the `?`, like `String name;`, then `name` cannot be `null` and must always be assigned a non-null `String` value. If you try to assign `null` to it or fail to initialize it, Dart will produce an error.

   ```dart
   String name = "Alice"; // Valid
   name = null; // Compilation error
   ```

The nullable type `String?` is a feature of Dart's sound null safety, which was introduced to help prevent null reference errors. It helps make your code safer by making it clear which variables can be null and which cannot.
